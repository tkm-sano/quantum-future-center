# Quantum Future Society Design Research Center

## Purpose of Establishment

Quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing possess the potential to fundamentally transform social structures as **next-generation foundational technologies**, following AI and the Internet. In recent years, progress has been made in **quantum error correction**, the development of **international testbeds** toward the quantum internet, and the **social implementation** of quantum sensing. The market size is expected to reach **tens of trillions of yen by the 2040s**.

The essence of these technologies lies in their ability to **transform human behavior**, which in turn accumulates to bring about **societal transformation**. For example, the widespread adoption of quantum-secure communication promotes the behavior of "**sharing information securely**," while quantum computing makes "**simulation-based decision-making**" a part of daily life. These behavioral shifts serve as the keys to “**future society design**,” updating systems and economic structures.

Currently, there are no established research centers that systematically study and practice quantum technologies from the perspective of **behavioral and social transformation**. This Center aims to serve as a **leading hub** that approaches the social impact of quantum technologies through the lens of **designing the future society**.

## Research Plan

### I. **Behavioral Transformation through Quantum Technologies** (4 fields)
- **Quantum Security and Everyday Behavior**: How the spread of quantum technologies influences daily practices of sharing and trust  
- **Quantum Computing and Decision-Making Styles**: How design, policy, and R&D processes change through quantum computing  
- **Quantum Sensing and Environmental Awareness**: How high-sensitivity sensing reshapes risk perception and response behaviors  
- **Quantum Networks and Collaborative Action**: How shared distributed resources alter collaboration in research, industry, and civil society  

### II. **Social Transformation through Layered Behavioral Change** (3 fields)
- **Institutional Design and Norm Formation**: The impact of quantum technology diffusion on governance, standardization, and regulatory frameworks  
- **Economic System Transformation**: The restructuring effects of quantum economies (clouds, finance, and supply chains)  
- **Social Acceptance Dynamics**: Understanding, anxiety, and ethical issues surrounding public acceptance  

### III. **Designing the Quantum Future Society** (4 fields)
- **Quantum Social Infrastructure Model**: Designing an integrated vision combining communication networks, computing clouds, and sensor networks  
- **Quantum City and Lifestyle Model**: Designing infrastructure, lifestyles, and communities integrating quantum technologies  
- **Quantum Human Resources and Collaborative Ecosystem**: Building interdisciplinary networks across science, design, social science, and policy  
- **Inclusive Social Scenarios**: Designing sustainable futures ensuring the fair distribution of benefits  

## Activity Plan (Four Pillars)

- **Testbed Collaboration**: Co-developing use cases connected to quantum internet demonstrations  
- **Standardization and International Collaboration**: Organizing workshops, joining standardization working groups, and promoting joint research  
- **Human Resource Development**: Building interdisciplinary programs combining quantum, design, and social sciences  
- **Public Engagement and Dialogue**: Facilitating ELSI dialogue, design fiction, and public events to visualize discussions  

## Collaboration and Outcomes (Long-term Perspective)

The Center engages in **horizontal collaboration** with quantum internet demonstrations, industry–academia–government talent development programs, international workshops, and standardization initiatives. It will function as a **design hub for social transformation**, leading the **inclusive and practical realization** of quantum technology’s inevitable social implementation.
